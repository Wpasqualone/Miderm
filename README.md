Midterm/High Quality Coding

Unit testing is a coding practice for properly testing code. The main ideas of unit testing is to write small chunks of code, and test them all separately.
This can be achieved by writing small amounts of code at once, or by taking chunks of code and moving them to a new program folder in order to test them separately. 
This system helps cut down on dependencies and ensure that all chunks of code that you write all separately work.
